# Advent of Code 2023 C#

C# chosen as a way to refamiliarise with it and better understand usage outside of game development

## Days

### Day 1
Simple file reader method

Leant on prior Regex knowledge 

### Day 2
Separated file reader into Helper class

More regexing to extract data from splits

### Day 3
Change part answer methods to accept input rather than parsing input within function for easier testing

Not fully thrilled with method layout for part 2 in particular

### Day 4
Less Regex this time

### Day 5

Horrible brute force solve

### Day 6

Using actual string utils this time

### Day 7

Enums and some collection utils, almmost certainly misuing them

Part 2 solve doesn't feel super DRY or KISS but works well enough, pattern matching is neat

### Day 8

Tried far too long to brute force before accepting LCM

Added LCM bits to helpers

### Day 9

Looping, appending, and prepending

### Day 10

Spent far too long trying to be clever with bit comparisons

Part 1: Weird inverse Djikstra-esque flood fill

Part 2 (Take 1): Genuinely could not get head around after quite a few attempts
